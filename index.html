      <h2>Introduction to Streams</h2>
      <p>
        In this study, we explore three types of streams:
        <strong>ReadableStreams</strong> (data sources), <strong>TransformStreams</strong> (data manipulation),
        and <strong>WritableStreams</strong> (data utilization). Streams process data asynchronously in "chunks",
        ensuring real-time processing without blocking. Unlike traditional callback-based models, Node.js streams are promise-based, leveraging a smoother development experience.
      </p>
      <p>
        Streams are implemented in pipelines, enabling a continuous flow of data. Examples include the <code>fs</code> module
        for chunk-based file processing and the <code>http</code> module with status code 206 for serving partial content periodically, similar to a socket HTTP connection.

      <h2>Recreating RxJS with Native Streams</h2>
      <p>
        Inspired by RxJS—a library following the reactive paradigm—we built a study canvas that allows free drawing with mouse or touch inputs.
        This implementation integrates core operators such as <code>FromEvent</code>, <code>Map</code>, <code>Merge</code>, <code>SwitchMap</code>, and <code>TakeUntil</code>.
        The video tutorial by (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-q5HhC71TBE" target="_blank" rel="noopener" rel="noreferrer"><strong>Erick Wendel</strong></a>)
        served as the primary reference for this project.
